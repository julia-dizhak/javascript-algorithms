an implementation of WeightedUnionFind: I think it's an error on medium with this.find
what is compression about?

check Here is a full js implementation, taken partly from Michael Toth’s JS visualisation of percolation through union find. I added compression, which Michael did not implement. I also changed the naming so it’s easier to read.
