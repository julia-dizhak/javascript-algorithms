recursion approach
update readme
check anki card


237 provide pictures
write a linked list ds and provide usual way of deleting with delete a node
provide test

226 invert
second approach: iterative
breadth first search definition queue
depth first search - stack

1 two sum
one pass hash table
2 pass hash table
2-pass approach can only implement with map?
update a readme and Hash component
google youtube
solution with map
check solution it's an open
put solution to leetcode

2 sum input arr sorted: move to separate task, create a test
binary search
2 pointers
test on leetcode

follow up design two sum data structure

380
check desc again, more clear why it's O(1)
provide all  tests
check swap https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/discuss/683882/Heavily-commented-JavaScript-Solution-with-thought-process-explained
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/discuss/684251/JavaScript-Clean-Solution-Using-Map-and-Array
and left a comment = override simply works
use arr and hash https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/discuss/436771/JavaScript-Array-of-values-and-Map-of-values-and-locations-in-array
check 2 hashes solution
move to anky

use counting sort to check

create a doc and share with vasyl
about positions: check book frontend interviews

medium
algorithmes and coding interviews: do i need subscribe
https://medium.com/algorithms-and-leetcode
check couple of articles


quick find
create anki: describe api, complexity
add to readme

//
quick union: check implementation
add a readme
an implementation of WeightedUnionFind: I think it's an error on medium with this.find
what is compression about?

check Here is a full js implementation, taken partly from Michael Toth’s JS visualisation of percolation through union find. I added compression, which Michael did not implement. I also changed the naming so it’s easier to read.
