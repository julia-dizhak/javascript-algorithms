# Computer science algorithms by JavaScript
The repo contains JavaScript implementations of different famous computer science algorithms.

## Algorithms
Contains description, solution and characteristics: runtime or complexity
Development by
[ES6](http://es6-features.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the Javascript compiler, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with a syntax highlighter [Highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/).

## Number
Is number a prime? runtime O(n), O(sqrt(n))

How could you find all prime factors of a number? / runtime O(n), O(Math.log2(n))

Find unique symbol in string / runtime O(n), runtime O(1)

Factorialize a Number, for example, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120 (3 versions: factorial, while loop, for loop) / runtime O(n) / test

Write all possible positive solutions for a^3+b^3 = c^3 + d^3, where a, b, c, d lie between [0, 10^5] / runtime O(n^4), O(n^3), O(n^2)

Translate a number by alphabetic code to a string, for example, solutions(123) --> 'abc', 'mc', 'ax' / test


---
### String
Count the number of occurrences of all characters in a string. / runtime O(n)

Find unique symbol in string / runtime O(n), runtime O(1)

Find repeat symbol in string / runtime O(n)

isPermutation 'rat' --> 'tar' / runtime O(n)

Check if string is palindrome / runtime O(n)


---
### Array
Merge two sorted arrays / test

Linear search (or find index method) / runtime O(n)

Find duplicates in array if only one duplicate is possible;

Find all duplicates in array (multiply duplicates) and return array without duplicates / runtime O(n), O(1);

Eliminate all duplicates in array / runtime O(1)

Find last element in array and increase (+1) using addition rules
