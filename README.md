# Computer science algorithms by Javascript
The repo contains Javascript implementations of different famous computer science algorithms.

## Algorithms
Tasks contain description, solution and characteristics: runtime or complexity.
The idea don't use the default, in-built methods of Javascript, for example, sort(), reverse() and etc.

Development by
[ES6](http://es6-features.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the Javascript compiler, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with a syntax highlighter [Highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/).

[Demo](https://julia-dizhak.github.io/javascript-algorithms/)

Tests run by `npm test`



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## GitHub Pages
Deployment on github pages
if git use ssh
`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:julia-dizhak/javascript-algorithms.git`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
