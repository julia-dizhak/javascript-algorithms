Insertion sort

Invariants
Entries to the left of ↑ (including ↑) are in ascending order.
Entries to the right of ↑ have not yet been seen.

To maintain algorithms invariants:
- Move pointer to the right i++;
- Moving from right to the left, exchange a[i] with each larger entry to its left


In Insertion Sort Part 2: learning exercise

Guideline: You already can place an element into a sorted array.
How can you use that code to build up a sorted array, one element at a time?
Note that in the first step, when you consider an array with just the first element,
it is already sorted since there's nothing to compare it to.

Print the array after each iteration of the insertion sort, i.e.,
whenever the next element has been inserted at its correct position.
Since the array composed of just the first element is already sorted,
begin printing after placing the second element.

For example, there are n=7 elements in [3,4,7,5,6,2,1].
Working from left to right, we get the following output:
3 4 7 5 6 2 1
3 4 7 5 6 2 1
3 4 5 7 6 2 1
3 4 5 6 7 2 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
