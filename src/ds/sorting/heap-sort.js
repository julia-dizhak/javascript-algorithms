/*
Island Perimeter

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents
land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island
(i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water
around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is
rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.


Input:
[ [0,1,0,0],
  [1,1,1,0],
  [0,1,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0]
]
Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

/*
Approach traversal

Since there are no lakes, every pair of neighbour cells with different values is part of the perimeter (more precisely, the edge between them is). So just count the differing pairs, both horizontally and vertically (for the latter I simply transpose the grid).
