167 Two sum II - input array is sorted
easy

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers
such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution
and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

/* Approach brute force
(the same like for 2 sum problem )

Intuition

3-44
Q. Are numbers are integer?
Q. Could numbers be negative?

Simplest solution to compare every possible pair
I could just have 2 For loops.
One scanning a whole thing from i and the second one
starting from j = i+1

two sum with duplicates
expect(twoSumSorted([1, 2, 4, 4], 8)).toEqual([2, 3]);

/*
Approach hash table
But it costs O(n) extra space + it doesn't make use of fact that the input is
already sorted
*/


/*
Approach binary search

For each element x, we would look up if target - x exists in O( log n) time by
applying binary search over the sorted array

Total time is O(n log n)
Space is O(1)

/*
Approach 2 pointers

Let’s assume we have two indices pointing to the i-th and j-th elements,
Ai and Aj respectively. The sum of Ai and Aj could only fall into one of these
three possibilities:

1. Ai + Aj > target. Increasing i isn’t going to help us, as it makes the sum even
bigger. Therefore we should decrement j.

2. Ai + Aj < target. Decreasing j isn’t going to help us, as it makes the sum even
smaller. Therefore we should increment i.

3. Ai + Aj == target. We have found the answer.
