/**
 * Binary search is a textbook algorithm based on the idea to compare the target value to the middle element of the array.
 * If the target value is equal to the middle element - we're done.
 * If the target value is smaller - continue to search on the left.
 * If the target value is larger - continue to search on the right.
 *
 * Binary search must always operated on sth which is sorted
 * and returns either the index of the location in the array,
 * or -1 if the array did not contain the target Value.
 *
 * You probably already have an intuitive idea that binary search makes fewer guesses than linear search
 *
 * Complexity analysis
 *
 * Time complexity: O(logN).
 * Let's compute time complexity with the help of master theorem ...
 * The equation represents dividing the problem up into a subproblems of size ...
 * Here at step there is only one subproblem a = 1, its size is a half of the initial problem b = 2,
 * and all this happens in a constant time d = 0.
 * And hence we're dealing with case 2 that results O(logN) time complexity.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(1) since it's a constant space solution.
