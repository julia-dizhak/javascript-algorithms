969 Pancake sorting
medium

Given an array of integers A, We need to sort the array performing a series of
pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 0 <= k < A.length.
Reverse the sub-array A[0...k].
For example, if A = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 2,
we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so A = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 2.

Return an array of the k-values of the pancake flips that should be performed
in order to sort A. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * A.length
flips will be judged as correct.

Example 1:
Input: A = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation:
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
Notice that we return an array of the chosen k values of the pancake flips.

Example 2:
Input: A = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= A.length
All integers in A are unique (i.e. A is a permutation of the integers from 1 to
A.length).

/*
Approach strait forward

Explanation
It's called "Pancake Flip" because, like a stack of pancakes, if you're going to
flip some of the pancakes, you have to flip from the top of the stack up until
a certain point. You can't flip only some section below the top.

Or
It makes way more sense when you think about the array standing vertically like
stack of pancakes. You must take a section from the top (beginning), including k
pancakes in your flip.


Note 1
there is no unique solution for this problem

Note 2
Note If you see the like vs dislike ratio < 1. Because this problem is poor
written, it is not clearly mentioned in the problem we need to return result 1
indexed based.

Example: A[] = [3, 2, 4, 1]

As, we have 4 elements in the array 1 - 4.
Let start to move 4 on its correct position.
find index for 4 return 2
flip array at 2 and then 3 -->  [3, 2, 4, 1] --> [4, 2, 3, 1] -->  [1, 3, 2, 4]
Also, add both flip operation k as 1 based so [3, 4]

Now perform for 3.
index = 1
flip array at 1 and 2 --> [1, 3, 2, 4] --> [3, 1, 2, 4] --> [2, 1, 3, 4]
list = [3, 4, 2, 3]

Now perform for 2.
index = 0
flip array at 0 and 1 --> [2, 1, 3, 4] --> [2, 1, 3, 4] --> [1, 2, 3, 4]
list = [3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2]

Now perform for 1.
index = 0
flip array at 0 and 1 --> [1, 3, 2, 4] --> [1, 3, 2, 4] --> [1, 3, 2, 4]
list = [3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1]

As, per the problem we can flip subarray from 0 to k where 0 â‰¤ k < A.length,
this give us a hint first find the index of largest element and move it to the
correct place how to do that?

1 find the index of that element using find helper function.
2 now flip the array form 0 to the find index.
3 now flip the array from 0 the correct place of that element
4 Above 3 operation we have to perform for all elements from n to 1.

similar as bubble sort?
similar as selection sort?

Approach like Sort like a bubble sort

Intuition

One might argue that this is an awkward question to do things. Indeed, it is not
the most practical operation that one can have with the pancake flipping, in order
to sort a list.

However awkward the problem might be, it is the game that we play with. And in
order to win the game, we have to play by the rules. Actually, from this perspective,
this problem does share some similarity with the Rubik's cube, i.e. one cannot
move one tile without moving other tiles along with. Let us get on with it, by
playing a few rounds ourselves to get the hang of the problem.

Given the input of [3, 2, 4, 1], the desired sorted output would be [1, 2, 3, 4].

As a reminder, the only operation that we could perform in order to move the
elements in the list, is the so-called pancake flip, which is to reverse a prefix
of the list.

Starting from the largest value in the list, i.e. 4 in the example, its desired
position would be the tail of the list. While in the input, it is located at the
third of the list, if we look at the list from left to right.

In order to move the value of 4 to its desired position, we could perform the
following two steps:

- Firstly, we do the pancake flip on the prefix of [3, 2, 4]. With this operation,
we then move the value 4 to the head of the updated list as [4, 2, 3, 1].

- Now that, the value 4 is located at the head of the list, we could now perform
another pancake flip on the entire list, which would get us the list of [1, 3, 2, 4].

Voila. With the obtained list of [1, 3, 2, 4], we are now one step closer to our
final goal, with the value 4 now at its proper place. For the following steps,
we only need to focus on the sublist of [1, 3, 2].

If one looks over the above steps again, it might ring a bell to a well-known
algorithm called bubble sort.

The idea is simple. First we move the number to the head of the list, then we
can switch it with any other element by performing another pancake flip.


Algorithm

One can inspire from the bubble sort to implement the algorithm.

1 First of all, we implement a function called flip(list, k), which performs the
pancake flip on the prefix of list[0:k] (in Python).

2 The main algorithm runs a loop over the values of the list, starting from the
largest one.

- At each round, we identify the value to sort (named as value_to_sort), which is
the number we would put in place at this round.

- We then locate the index of the value_to_sort.

- If the value_to_sort is not at its place already, we can then perform at most
two pancake flips as we explained in the intuition.

- At the end of the round, the value_to_sort would be put in place.
