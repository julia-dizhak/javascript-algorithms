222 Count complete Tree Nodes
medium

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last,
is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.


Example 1 - tree is complete
Input:
    1

  2   3

Output: 6

Approach Recursion

The height of a binary tree is the largest number of edges in a path from the root
node to a leaf node. Essentially, it is the height of the root node.
Note that if a tree has only one node, then that node is at the same time the
root node and the only leaf node, so the height of the tree is 0.

Fully completed tree === Perfect binary tree

Number of nodes in completed binary tree (perfect binary tree) = 2^levels - 1

Algorithm
1 A fully completed tree has node number: count = 2 ^ depth - 1
for example: [1,2,3], depth is 2, count = 2 ^ 2 - 1 = 3

2 Compare left height and right height, if equal, use the formula,
otherwise recursively search left and right at next level

3 The search pattern is very similar to binary search, the difference of heights
either exists in left side, or right side

For those who are confused with (1 << leftDepth) - 1 ( => 1 << leftDepth = 1 * 2^leftDepth)
This is done to find the nodes when depth is known.
Suppose there are N nodes in a tree, then depth = log2(n+1)
1 node gives log2(2) = 1
3 nodes gives log2(4) = 2
7 nodes gives log2(8) = 3
15 nodes gives log2(16) = 4
what we are doing in this line (1 << leftDepth) - 1 is given Depth we will find
Number of nodes,
N = 2 ^ depth - 1.

Complexity analysis
time complexity is O(log(n)^2)
if you draw the recursion tree and you will find that in every level,
there will always be one left or right subtree is a complete tree and will
just return. So every level's time is O(log n),
total time complexity is O(log(n) ^ 2)
