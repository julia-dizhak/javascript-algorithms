215 Find the kth largest (smallest) element in an unsorted array.
medium

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the
kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Or find the kth smallest element.
Problem related to Quick select algorithm

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length

/*
Approach sort
if you wanna find a smallest you look on first position,
largest - last, median

time O(n log n)
space is O(1)
*/
var findKthLargestSort = function(nums, k) {
  nums = nums.sort((a,b) => a - b);
  return nums[nums.length - k];

Approach quicksort partition schema

During sorting we are doing extra work - still doing more work that we need to do.
Because we know after sorting every kth element, but we need to know only one.

We wanna find a selection algorithm which runs in linear time. There is a solution
based on partition.

In quicksort, we pick a pivot element, then move the pivot element to its correct
position and partition the array around it. The idea is, not to do complete
quicksort, but stop at the point where pivot itself is kth smallest element.

The basic idea is to use Quick Select algorithm to partition the array with pivot:
Put numbers < pivot to pivot's left
Put numbers > pivot to pivot's right
Then
if indexOfPivot == k, return A[k]
else if indexOfPivot < k, keep checking left part to pivot
else if indexOfPivot > k, keep checking right part to pivot

Partition array around pivot so that
- entry a[j] in place
- no larger entry to the left of j
- no smaller entry to the right of j
Repeat in one subarray, depending on j; finished when j equals k;

Complexity
The average case for quick select is O(n) while the worst case is O(n2).

Discard half each time: n+(n/2)+(n/4)..1 = n + (n-1) = O(2n-1) = O(n),
because n/2+n/4+n/8+..1 = n-1.

        Found. The pivot is index on index n - k. This is literally its final

        We don't need to sort the whole array
