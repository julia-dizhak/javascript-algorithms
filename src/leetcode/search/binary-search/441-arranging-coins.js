441 Arranging coins
easy

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where
every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
integer.

Example 1: n = 5
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Example 2: n = 8
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

Approach Binary search

Assume that the answer is k, i.e. we've managed to complete k rows of coins
These completed rows contain in total
1 + 2 + ... + k = k*(k+1)/2 coins.

We could now reformulate the problem as follows:
find the maximum k such that k*(k+1)/2 <= N

The problem seems to be one of those search problems which you can solve using a binary search.
As well we can find in another similar problem called search insert position (Leetcode 35).

time is O(log n)
space is O(1)

    let current = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;

    if (current === n) return mid;
    if (current < n) {
      left = mid + 1;

      right = mid - 1;

/*
Approach Math (Gauss)

If we look deeper into the formula of the problem, we could actually solve it
with the help of mathematics, without using any iteration.

As a reminder, the constraint of the problem can be expressed as follows:
k*(k+1) <= 2*N
x² + x = 2n
x² + x + 1/4 - 1/4 = 2n
(x + 1/2)² = 2n + 1/4
(x + 1/2)² = (8n + 1) / 4
x + 1/2 = sqrt(8n + 1) / 2
x = (sqrt(8n + 1) / 2) - 1/2
x = (sqrt(8n + 1) - 1)/2

or formula x = sqrt(2n + 1/4) - 1/2

Time complexity: O(1).
Space complexity: O(1).
